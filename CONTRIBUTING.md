# Contributing to Claude How To

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This guide will help you understand how to contribute effectively.

## About This Project

Claude How To is a visual, example-driven guide to Claude Code. We provide:
- **Mermaid diagrams** explaining how features work
- **Production-ready templates** you can use immediately
- **Real-world examples** with context and best practices
- **Progressive learning paths** from beginner to advanced

## Types of Contributions

### 1. New Examples or Templates
Add examples for existing features (slash commands, skills, hooks, etc.):
- Copy-paste ready code
- Clear explanations of how it works
- Use cases and benefits
- Troubleshooting tips

### 2. Documentation Improvements
- Clarify confusing sections
- Fix typos and grammar
- Add missing information
- Improve code examples

### 3. Feature Guides
Create guides for new Claude Code features:
- Step-by-step tutorials
- Architecture diagrams
- Common patterns and anti-patterns
- Real-world workflows

### 4. Bug Reports
Report issues you encounter:
- Describe what you expected
- Describe what actually happened
- Include steps to reproduce
- Add relevant Claude Code version and OS

### 5. Feedback and Suggestions
Help improve the guide:
- Suggest better explanations
- Point out gaps in coverage
- Recommend new sections or reorganization

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone
```bash
git clone https://github.com/luongnv89/claude-howto.git
cd claude-howto
```

### 2. Create a Branch
Use a descriptive branch name:
```bash
git checkout -b add/feature-name
git checkout -b fix/issue-description
git checkout -b docs/improvement-area
```

### 3. Set Up Your Environment

Pre-commit hooks run the same checks as CI locally before every commit. All four checks must pass before a PR will be accepted.

**Required dependencies:**

```bash
# Python tooling (uv is the package manager for this project)
pip install uv
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r scripts/requirements-dev.txt

# Markdown linter (Node.js)
npm install -g markdownlint-cli

# Mermaid diagram validator (Node.js)
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli

# Install pre-commit and activate hooks
uv pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

**Verify your setup:**

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

The hooks that run on every commit are:

| Hook | What it checks |
|------|---------------|
| `markdown-lint` | Markdown formatting and structure |
| `cross-references` | Relative links, anchors, code fences |
| `mermaid-syntax` | All ` ```mermaid ` blocks parse correctly |
| `link-check` | External URLs are reachable |
| `build-epub` | EPUB generates without errors (on `.md` changes) |
