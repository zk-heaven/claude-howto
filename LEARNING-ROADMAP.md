# 📚 Claude Code Learning Roadmap

**New to Claude Code?** This guide helps you master Claude Code features at your own pace. Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced developer, start with the self-assessment quiz below to find the right path for you.

---

## 🧭 Find Your Level

Not everyone starts from the same place. Take this quick self-assessment to find the right entry point.

**Answer these questions honestly:**

- [ ] I can start Claude Code and have a conversation (`claude`)
- [ ] I have created or edited a CLAUDE.md file
- [ ] I have used at least 3 built-in slash commands (e.g., /help, /compact, /model)
- [ ] I have created a custom slash command or skill (SKILL.md)
- [ ] I have configured an MCP server (e.g., GitHub, database)
- [ ] I have set up hooks in ~/.claude/settings.json
- [ ] I have created or used custom subagents (.claude/agents/)
- [ ] I have used print mode (`claude -p`) for scripting or CI/CD

**Your Level:**

| Checks | Level | Start At | Time to Complete |
|--------|-------|----------|------------------|
| 0-2 | **Level 1: Beginner** — Getting Started | [Milestone 1A](#milestone-1a-first-commands--memory) | ~3 hours |
| 3-5 | **Level 2: Intermediate** — Building Workflows | [Milestone 2A](#milestone-2a-automation-skills--hooks) | ~5 hours |
| 6-8 | **Level 3: Advanced** — Power User & Team Lead | [Milestone 3A](#milestone-3a-advanced-features) | ~5 hours |

> **Tip**: If you're unsure, start one level lower. It's better to review familiar material quickly than to miss foundational concepts.

> **Interactive version**: Run `/self-assessment` in Claude Code for a guided, interactive quiz that scores your proficiency across all 10 feature areas and generates a personalized learning path.

---

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

The folders in this repository are numbered in **recommended learning order** based on three key principles:

1. **Dependencies** - Foundational concepts come first
2. **Complexity** - Easier features before advanced ones
3. **Frequency of Use** - Most common features taught early

This approach ensures you build a solid foundation while gaining immediate productivity benefits.

## 🆘 Common Learning Challenges

### Challenge 1: "Too many concepts at once"
**Solution**: Focus on one milestone at a time. Complete all exercises before moving forward.

### Challenge 2: "Don't know which feature to use when"
**Solution**: Refer to the [Use Case Matrix](README.md#use-case-matrix) in the main README.

### Challenge 3: "Configuration not working"
**Solution**: Check the [Troubleshooting](README.md#troubleshooting) section and verify file locations.

### Challenge 4: "Concepts seem to overlap"
**Solution**: Review the [Feature Comparison](README.md#feature-comparison) table to understand differences.

### Challenge 5: "Hard to remember everything"
**Solution**: Create your own cheat sheet. Use checkpoints to experiment safely.

### Challenge 6: "I'm experienced but not sure where to start"
**Solution**: Take the [Self-Assessment Quiz](#-find-your-level) above. Skip to your level and use the prerequisites check to identify any gaps.
